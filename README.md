# TailorDesk-Shop-Manager-for-Tailors
TailorDesk is a digital management system for tailoring shops, especially ladies tailors. It replaces the traditional notebook-based system by managing customers, saving measurements, tracking orders, assigning statuses (Pending, Cutting, Stitching, Ready, Delivered), storing design references, and maintaining customer history for future orders.
